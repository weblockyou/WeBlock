# WeBlock

What is WeBlock? 

This site is stimulated by the story of df595149790 who is a WeChat China user. 
We will call him DF as he calls himself. 

DF is blocked serveral days ago by Tencent which is the developer company of WeChat and also do the daily operating for WeChat. 
But there is NO description to tell the reason of blocking. 
DF want to know the detail, then he start appeal according to the WeChat Blocking Appeal Guideline released by Tencent. 
When he send an appeal request, the next day Tecent will send him a response which only contains words of "You breaks XXX Law, please obey YYY Law".
This is not want DF want to known, he want to know the detail reason of blocking. 
Then DF start a new appeal request when he receive the wrong response. 
Again and again. 
Months passed, DF get nothing BUT the same sentence from Tencent.

I want to konw the reason of WeChat blocking when I heared the story of DF, 
and I also want to know why Tencent DONOT tell the detail of blocking.

When I think more, I realized that this is not a rare case for WeChat but a common case for many social platform in our world.

Then I created this project, the name of "WeBlock" means "We can Block you without any reason". 

I want other people to tell us the likely story in this project, and try to do some action to stop the blocking action by social platfrom.   

> ***Our world needs OPEN not CLOSE***
