# WeBlock

What is WeBlock? 

This site is stimulated by the story of df595149790 who is a WeChat China user. 
We will call him DF as he calls himself. 

DF is blocked serveral days ago by Tencent who is the developer company of WeChat and also do the daily operating for WeChat. 
But there is NO description to tell the blocking reason. 
DF want to know the detail, then he start appeal according to the WeChat Blocking Appeal Guideline released by Tencent. 
When he send an appeal request, the next day Tencent will send him a response which only contains words like 
```
You breaks XXX Rule, please obey YYY Law.
```
This is not what DF want to known, he want the detail reason of blocking. 
Then DF start a new appeal request when he receive the wrong response. 
Again and again. 
Months passed, DF get nothing BUT the same sentence from Tencent.

I want to konw the WeChat blocking reason when I heared the story of DF, 
and I also want to know **why Tencent DONOT tell the detail of blocking**,
and is this blocking behaviour legal for Tencent in China? 

When I think more, I realized that this is not a rare case for WeChat but a common case for many social platform in our world.

Then I created this project, the name of "WeBlock" means 
```
We can Block you without any reason
```

I want other people to tell the same like story in this project, and try to stop the blocking action by social platfrom.
